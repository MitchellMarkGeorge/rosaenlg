= Development, packaging and rendering of the RosaeNLG templates

As RosaeNLG is primarly a node.js library, the easiest setup is just to use it in a simple node.js app: see xref:quickstart.adoc#node.js[Quick Start].

Still, there are multiple other possible ways to use RosaeNLG. A pipeline has 3 steps:

. *develop* NLG templates
. *package* the templates - which can be optional depending how you will run them
. *render* the templates to generate production texts

.Typical setups
[options="header"]
|=====================================================================
| Situation | Develop | Package | Render
| if you like node.js 
3+| one single node.js project using RosaeNLG npm library, and containing the templates
| if you need to have Java for production
| node.js project to develop the templates 
| use xref:gulp.adoc[Gulp Helper] to package them
| xref:java-server:java-server.adoc[RosaeNLG Java Server] to render them
| if you don't like node.js neither Java (but ok with Docker)
2+| use xref:rosaenlg-cli.adoc[Docker CLI for RosaeNLG] to develop, test and package your templates
| xref:java-server:java-server.adoc[dockerized version of RosaeNLG Java Server] to render them through an API
|=====================================================================


== Develop RosaeNLG templates

* Just create a node.js project and use RosaeNLG npm library. You can use xref:boilerplate.adoc[the RosaeNLG node.js boilerplate project] as a starting point for your NLG project.
* Alternatively, you can use xref:rosaenlg-cli.adoc[Docker CLI for RosaeNLG] to test and render your templates. Just use VSCode (or whatever editor) to edit your templates, and test them using the Docker CLI.
* For very small projects, you could the link:https://rosaenlg.org/ide/demo_en_US.html[browser IDE].


== Package RosaeNLG templates

*Most of the time you don't have to package anything:* templates can directly be rendered server side. Pug's integrated cache system is very efficient, compile will occur only once automatically.

* Use xref:gulp.adoc[Gulp Helper]:
** to compile templates for client side rendering with `compileTemplates`
** to package templates in a JSON file, to use in xref:java-server:java-server.adoc[RosaeNLG Java Server], with `packageTemplateJson`
* Alternatively you can use xref:rosaenlg-cli.adoc[Docker CLI for RosaeNLG] to package templates in a single JSON file.
* You might use xref:java-wrapper:java-wrapper.adoc[Java Wrapper] to compile templates, for browser rendering typically.


== Render RosaeNLG templates

* Create a node.js app (server, batch, whatever) using RosaeNLG npm library and use `renderFile` to render your templates.
* Render your templates directly in a browser, client-side, after having compiled them in the packaging process.
* Create a java application and use the xref:java-wrapper:java-wrapper.adoc[RosaeNLG Java Wrapper] to render your templates.
* Run a xref:java-server:java-server.adoc[RosaeNLG Java Server] (standalone server or in Tomcat) and use the API to load JSON packaged templates and render them.
* Use the xref:java-server:java-server.adoc[dockerized version of RosaeNLG Java Server] to do exactly the same.
