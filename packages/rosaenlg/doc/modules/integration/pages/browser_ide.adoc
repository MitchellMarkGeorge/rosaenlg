= Browser IDE

The link:https://rosaenlg.org/ide/demo_en_US.html[browser IDE] is actually not a real IDE but is handy to develop simple RosaeNLG templates.

Develop templates:
* Start by choosing an example template. *Be careful as it will replace your current template.*
* Make some modifications and push the `Render` button. Generated texts will appear on the right.

You can switch to another language.

Export/save options:
* use `Save` to download a plain text file containing your template
* use `Package JSON` to download a JSON package of your template; this package can be deployed on a RosaeNLG API
* use `Package compiled JavaScript` to export your template as a plain JavaScript function
* `Package compiled JavaScript - with export` is the same but adds a `export default` at the end to be able to use the JavaScript as a node module
