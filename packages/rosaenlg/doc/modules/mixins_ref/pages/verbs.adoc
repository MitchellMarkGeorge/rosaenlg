= Verbs

A proper NLG system is able to make conjugations.
Classic structures are subject/verb or subject/verb/adjective.

TIP: Supported persons are 3rd person singular & plural only.

Before anything we need to define what subjects can be.

== Subjects

A subject has to have a gender and a number. A simple way to define a subject is to use an existing js object and to affect it a gender and a number.
....
var PRODUCT = {something: 'somehow'};
setRefGender(PRODUCT, 'M');
setRefNumber(PRODUCT, 'P');
....

TIP: in French, German, Italian and Spanish, `setRefGender(PRODUCT, 'bague');` will look for `bague` in the dictionnary and set `PRODUCT` gender to `F`. Same as `setRefGender(PRODUCT, 'F');` here.

If you don't want to bother with objects because they don't exist or are too insignificant to be really created, you can ask the system to provide anonymous subjects:
....
var subjS = getAnonymous('M', 'S');
....
`getAnonymous(gender, number)` will create an anonymous object and record is with the right gender and number. There are shortcuts: `getAnonMS()`, `getAnonMP()`, `getAnonFS()`, `getAnonFP()`.


At last, you can use complex structure like xref:referring_expression.adoc[referring expressions] to define your subjects.


== Conjugate verbs `subjectVerb` and `verb`

Use `subjectVerb(subject, verb)` to agree a verb with a subject.
`+subjectVerb(PRODUCT, 'shine')` will output _the ring shines_.

`verb(subject, verb)` will just output the agreed verb but not the subject.
`+verb(PRODUCT, 'shine')` will output _shines_.

Instead of putting directly a verb (like `shine`), you can add extra parameters for the verb, typically the tense.
`+subjectVerb(PRODUCT, {verb:'shine', tense:'PAST'})` will output _the ring shined_.

`subjectVerb` and `verb` also accept a last optional param which is transmitted as is to the subject. For instance, `+subjectVerb(PRODUCT, 'shine', {REPRESENTANT: 'refexpr'})` will force the referring expression representation of the product, thus outputting something like _it shines_.

Tenses are language specific, as well as some other parameters (e.g. the auxiliary in French). See specific parameters for:

* xref:verbs_english.adoc[English]
* xref:verbs_french.adoc[French]
* xref:verbs_german.adoc[German]
* xref:verbs_italian.adoc[Italian]
* xref:verbs_spanish.adoc[Spanish]


== Conjugate verbs _and_ agree adjectives with `subjectVerbAdj`

Use `subjectVerbAdj(subject, verbInfo, adjective)` to directly generate a subject, a conjugated verb and an agreed adjective.
`#[+subjectVerbAdj(PRODUCT, 'Ãªtre', 'luxueux')]` will output _la bague est luxueuse_.

`subjectVerbAdj` also accepts a last optional parameter that is transmitted as is to the subject.

Also see xref:adjectives.adoc[agree adjectives].
