= Client side in browser compiling and/or rendering

The idea is to do NLG in the browser. You can:

* xref:rendering.adoc[compile the templates server side and just render (generate texts) in the browser], which is the most common usage
* both xref:compiling.adoc[compile and render client side] in the browser
