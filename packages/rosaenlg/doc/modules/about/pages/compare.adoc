|=====================================================================

In summary CoreNLG is just perfect:

* if you use Python
* if you do not need sophisticated linguistic features likes verbs, words and ajectives agreements

RosaeNLG can be better:

* if you use Javascript or TypeScript
* if you wish to make browser side rendering
* if you need more readable templates
* if your NLG project requires linguistic resources
