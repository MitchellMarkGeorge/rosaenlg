In summary CoreNLG is just perfect:

* if you use Python
* if you do not need sophisticated linguistic features likes anaphora, verbs, words and ajectives agreements
* if you are not afraid of maintaining texts templates as Python code

RosaeNLG can be better:

* if you want more readable templates
* if your NLG project requires linguistic resources
* if you use Javascript or TypeScript
* if you wish to make browser side rendering
