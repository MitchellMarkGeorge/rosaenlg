= GraalVM runtime

If you can't or don't want to use node.js, and if client side execution is not an option either, RosaeNLG can run in a Java Virtual Machine using link:https://www.graalvm.org/[Graal VM].

See:

* link:https://gitlab.com/rosaenlg-projects/rosaenlg-graal-poc[Graal POC] which makes the tutorial run in a JVM
* link:https://gitlab.com/rosaenlg-projects/graal-packager[Graal Packager] is a helper project that packages templates properly for Graal
