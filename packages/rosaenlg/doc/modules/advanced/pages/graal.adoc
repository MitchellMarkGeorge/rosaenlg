= GraalVM runtime

If you can't or don't want to use node.js, and if client side execution is not an option either, RosaeNLG can run in a Java Virtual Machine using link:https://www.graalvm.org/[Graal VM].

You can choose between different bundled js versions of RosaeNLG to run on Graal:

* See all versions on xref:browser:intro.adoc[browser doc]. Most tinyfied versions were designed to be run in a browser, but will work well on Graal.
* If you don't want to bother, or need compilation or runtime ability in multiple output languages, you can also use the full version, with compilation ability on every supported language: `rosaenlg_fat_VERSION_comp.js` (about 75 Mb)

See sample projects:

* link:https://gitlab.com/rosaenlg-projects/rosaenlg-graal-poc[Graal POC] which makes the tutorial run in a JVM
* link:https://gitlab.com/rosaenlg-projects/graal-packager[Graal Packager] is a helper project that packages templates properly for Graal
