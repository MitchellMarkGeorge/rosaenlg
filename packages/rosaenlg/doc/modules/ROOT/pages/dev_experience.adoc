_how, in practice, develop RosaeNLG templates efficiently_

Initial setup:

* use VSCode as it has syntax highlighting for Pug - which is 90% the same as RosaeNLG
* fork the link:https://gitlab.com/rosaenlg-projects/rosaenlg-boilerplate[boilerplate project]
* run `npm install`

Develop:

* open a terminal within VSCode
* in that terminal run `npx rosaenlg-cli -l fr_FR -w templates\phoneCli.pug`
* just modify a template, save, and the result will be rendered in real time in the terminal

The `phoneCli.pug` template contains sample data: this is practical for development and debug, but that's all: your real data should no stay in templates.

Render:

* just use `gulp texts` to render texts in an HTML file
* adapt to generate a JSON file or whatever


Deploy to use as an API:

* create a xref:integration:node-server.adoc[RosaeNLG server] somewhere, AWS etc. with docker: `docker run -p 80:5000 -i registry.gitlab.com/rosaenlg-projects/rosaenlg/server:latest`
* run `gulp package` to get your packaged template in `dist/`
* push your template to your server using the API: `POST` on `/templates`
* render: `POST` to `/templates/phones/render`
