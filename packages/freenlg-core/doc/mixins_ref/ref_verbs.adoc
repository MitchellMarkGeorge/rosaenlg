== Verbs

A good NLG system is able to agree things and to make conjugations (that's the basis).
Classic structures are subject/verb or subject/verb/adjective.

Before anything we need to define what subjects can be.

=== Subjects

A subject has to have a gender and a number. A simple way to define a subject is to use an existing js object and to affect him a gender and a number.
....
var PRODUCT = {something: 'somehow'};
setRefGender(PRODUCT, 'M');
setRefNumber(PRODUCT, 'P');
....

If you don't want to bother with objects because they don't exist or are too insignificant to be really created, you can ask the system to provide anonymous subjects:
....
var subjS = getAnonymous('M', 'S');
....
`getAnonymous(gender, number)` will create an anonymous object and record is with the right gender and number.


At last, you can use complex structure like <<anaphoras>> to define your subjects.

=== Conjugate verbs `subjectVerb` and `verb`

Use `subjectVerb(subject, verb)` to agree a verb with a subject.
`+subjectVerb(PRODUCT, 'shine')` will output _the ring shines_.

`verb(subject, verb)` will just output the agreed verb but not the subject.
`+verb(PRODUCT, 'shine')` will output _shines_.

Instead of putting directly a verb (like `shine`), you can add extra parameters for the verb, typically the tense.
`+subjectVerb(PRODUCT, {verb:'shine', tense:'PAST'})` will output _the ring shined_.

English conjugations are made with `compromise` lib. Accepted tenses are:

* `PRESENT` which is also the default value
* `PAST`
* `FUTURE`

At last, `subjectVerb` and `verb` accept a last optional param which is transmitted as is to the subject. For instance, `+subjectVerb(PRODUCT, 'shine', {REPRESENTANT: 'ana'})` will force the anaphoric representation of the product, thus outputting something like _it shines_.

=== Conjugate verbs _and_ agree adjectives with `subjectVerbAdj`

Use `subjectVerbAdj(subject, verbInfo, adjective)` to directly generate a subject, a conjugated verb and an agreed adjective.
`#[+subjectVerbAdj(PRODUCT, 'Ãªtre', 'luxueux')]` will output _la bague est luxueuse_.

`subjectVerbAdj` also accepts a last optional parameter that is transmitted as is to the subject.

See <<agree_adjectives>>.


=== Language support for verbs

Coverage on verbs is still scarce.
