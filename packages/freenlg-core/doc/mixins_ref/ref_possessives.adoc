== Possessives with `recipientPossession` and `thirdPossession`

=== `thirdPossession`

Use it when you want to talk of a property of an object. If the object you talk about is a ring, you may want to talk about its weight, its size, etc. - texts like _the weight of the ring_, _its size_, etc.

You first have to manually indicate if a given substantive is masculine or feminine with `registerSubst(substantive, 'F' or 'M')`.
Then you use `thirdPossession(owner, owned)`.
....
-
  registerSubst('largeur', 'F');
  registerSubst('poids', 'M');

p #[+thirdPossession(PRODUCT, 'largeur')] / #[+thirdPossession(PRODUCT, 'poids')]
....
will output _la largeur de la bague / son poids_.

As usual it takes an optional last parameter that is sent as is to the subject.

=== `recipientPossession`

`recipientPossession(owned)` will output item as if owned by the reader. `#[+recipientPossession(PRODUCT)]` will output _votre bague_ or _vos boucles d'oreille_.
