== Agreement of nouns and adjectives

=== Substantive (or how to agree words)

`substantive(word, agreeWith)` will agree the word (with is just a noun) with `agreeWith`.

For instance:
....
-
  var DIAMONDS = {bla: 'bla'};
  setRefNumber(DIAMONDS, 'P');

p #[+substantive("diamond", DIAMONDS)]
....
This will output _diamonds_.

Works in `en_US` and `fr_FR`.

=== Agree adjectives `agreeAdj`

Use `agreeAdj(adjective, subject)` to agree an `adjective` with a `subject`.

For instance in `fr_FR`:
....
p #[+agreeAdj('luxueux', getAnonymous('F', 'P'))] / #[+agreeAdj('muni', getAnonymous('F', 'P'))]
....
will output _luxueuses / munies_.


In German you have to indicate both the case and the determiner:
....
p der #[+agreeAdj('alt', 'Gurke', {case:'GENITIVE', det:'DEFINITE'})] Gurke
....
will output _der alten Gurke_.
