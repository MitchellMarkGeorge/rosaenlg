= Developer documentation

Read this if you want to contribute to FreeNLG.
Alternatively, this is my own personal doc when I forget how things work.

== The repo

It is a multi package repo which is a fork of Pug @2.0.3 (as of 06/04/2018).

* `freenlg` is `pug` renamed. I try to do as little changes as possible.
* `freenlg-core` is the main package. It contains all FreeNLG's logic.

* `freenlg-pug-xxx` are forks of the original `pug-xxx` packages:
** Some of them are are unchanged, but I needed to fork them because they carry dependancies with changed packages: `freenlg-pug-lexer` `freenlg-pug-parser` `freenlg-pug-walk` `pug-code-gen`
** Some oft them care changed to handle specific structures like `synz > syn`: `freenlg-pug-filters` `freenlg-pug-linker` `freenlg-pug-load`

The repo also contains a copy of unchanged pug packages like `pug-attrs`, `pug-error` etc. TODO: remove them.
