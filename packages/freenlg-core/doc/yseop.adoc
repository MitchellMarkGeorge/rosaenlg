= Yseop template generator

https://www.yseop.com[Yseop] is a NLG software vendor.

While FreeNLG is a production grade NLG software, some users may prefer to switch to commercial software like Yseop for some reasons:

* Support
* Consulting / Professionnal Services
* Additionnal features
* Friendly UI
* Additionnal languages (Spanish, Dutch, Japanese etc.)

The migration feature is aimed at users who started creating FreeNLG templates and wish to switch their templates to Yseop.

WARNING: Pug/FreeNLG is based on Javascript while Yseop uses a proprietary language. All the Javascript snippets will not be migrated automatically.
