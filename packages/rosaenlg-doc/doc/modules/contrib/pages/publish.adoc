= Publish a new version

_this doc is just for me_

RosaeNLG packages:

* check non regression on another project
* check `changelog.adoc` content, but leave `== [Unreleased]`
* run `gulp release_xxxx` with patch / minor / major as xxxx; this must update `changelog.adoc`, `antora.yml` and github workflows (4 files)
* commit on the branch
* merge with master
* local environment: `lerna version --no-push --no-git-tag-version --exact patch` (or `minor` etc. instead of patch)
* commit
* make a `vXX.XX.XX` branch (to be seen by the doc project + to publish)
* push: `git push origin master`
* also push branch: `git push origin vXX.XX.XX`
* Github Actions should build and should publish on npm

Documentation:

* trigger the `antora-ui` project CI on github
* trigger the `docs-site` project CI on github and link:https://rosaenlg.github.io/docs-site[check the result]
* trigger the `antora-playbook` CI on github

Misc:

* then deploy on prod: `yarn run deploy:prod`
